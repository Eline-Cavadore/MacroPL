Power Measures according to the angle of the Pellin-Broca Prism:\
Maximum Power between 0 degree with -20 graduations on the screw and 0 degree with +20 graduations on the screw\
Graduations were identified with a black line om the top of the screw\
So, to maximize the power at the exit of the prism: \
**Put the turntable to 0 degree and align the graduation 0 on the screw with the black line on the top of the screw**
